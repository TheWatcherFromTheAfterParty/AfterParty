# After Party - An Alternate Reality Game

Welcome to **After Party**, an immersive Alternate Reality Game (ARG) designed to test your problem-solving skills, awareness, and ability to uncover hidden secrets. This game will take you through various phases, each with its own unique challenges and puzzles, based in Salt Lake City.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This will serve as the entry point to the game.

## Progress Tracking

Your progress is tracked using `localStorage`. This ensures that you can continue from where you left off, even if you close your browser.

### Important Notes

- **First Visit:** On your first visit to each phase, you will experience a typewriter animation that reveals the clues gradually.
- **Subsequent Visits:** On subsequent visits, the clues will be displayed immediately to save time.

## Styling

The game features a retro, terminal-like interface with neon green text on a black background. The CSS file (`style.css`) includes styles for glitch effects, typewriter animations, and more to enhance the immersive experience.

## Contributing

If you have any ideas or improvements for the game, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions from the community.
